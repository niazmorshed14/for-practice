AnnotationAnnotation essentially means marking up or writing notes on another file, like a PDF or JPG. Sometimes you need to scribble your own notes on a file, mark where you want to make changes, or highlight important information. While there are a few ways to edit a PDF, it makes sense to have annotation tools built into a single note-taking app that you can use for all kinds of notes so that you don't end up with notes in multiple places.
